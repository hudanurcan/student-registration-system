# student-registration-system
This project is a Student Registration System developed using Angular and Django. The system offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to add, update, delete, and list student records. The frontend is written with Angular, while the backend is built with Django. An SQLite database is used to store student information.

Technologies Used:
-Angular 18
-Django
-SqLite


Key Features:
-Add, update, and delete student records.
-List student records.


For the Django backend to work correctly, you'll need to install the following packages:
-Django: The web framework for the backend.
-djangorestframework: For building RESTful APIs.
-django-cors-headers: To handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and allow communication between frontend and backend.
